# Horiseon code refactor

## Description:
As a marketing agency, our company wanted a codebase that follows accessiblity and optimized for search engines.
The source code now contains semantic HTML elements, follows a logical structure independent of styling/positioning, alt attribute, heading attributes in sequential order, and finally we have given our webpage a title. This project reminded me the importance of HTML/CSS rules that I need to be mindful of such as selector specificiy, inline/block elements, and so on.
